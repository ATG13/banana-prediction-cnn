Project Overview
Banana ripeness level classification uses a CNN to categorize bananas into stages like unripe (green), ripening (yellowish-green), ripe, and overripe based on visual features such as color and texture. This aligns perfectly with your assignment by demonstrating convolution for feature extraction, pooling for dimensionality reduction, ReLU activations for non-linearity, and Adam optimization for training. A Streamlit app can provide the user interface for image uploads and predictions.​

Recommended Dataset
Use the Banana Ripeness Classification Dataset on Kaggle, containing over 13,000 images across ripeness stages, ideal for training a simple CNN. Alternatives include Roboflow's dataset with 5,616 banana images and pre-trained models for quick starts, or Mendeley's real/synthetic Cavendish banana images (3,495 real + 161,280 synthetic) for robustness. Download via Kaggle API: kaggle datasets download -d shahriar26s/banana-ripeness-classification-dataset.​

CNN Architecture
Build a simple CNN with 2-3 convolutional layers (32-64 filters, 3x3 kernels), max-pooling (2x2), dropout (0.25-0.5), and dense layers ending in softmax for multi-class output (e.g., 4 ripeness classes). Key components:​

Convolution extracts edges/colors via kernels.

Max-pooling reduces parameters while retaining features.

Flatten + Dense for classification, optimized with categorical cross-entropy.
Example in Keras: Input (224x224x3) → Conv2D(32,(3,3),ReLU) → MaxPool → Conv2D(64,(3,3),ReLU) → MaxPool → Flatten → Dense(128,ReLU) → Dropout → Dense(4,softmax).

Implementation Steps
Preprocessing: Resize to 224x224, normalize (0-1), augment (rotation/flip) with ImageDataGenerator, split 80/10/10.​

Training: Use Adam optimizer, batch size 32, epochs 20-50; monitor with EarlyStopping on validation accuracy.​

Evaluation: Compute accuracy (target >90%), precision/recall/F1, confusion matrix; visualize with matplotlib (loss/accuracy curves).​

Streamlit App: streamlit run app.py with st.file_uploader, preprocess image, predict via loaded model, display class probabilities.

Report Structure and Tips
Structure report with sections on problem (manual ripeness assessment limitations), methodology (CNN design), results (metrics/visuals), and discussion (91.7% accuracy achievable per literature). Include code on GitHub, model saved as .h5, and demo video/screenshots. Leverage your Python expertise (TensorFlow/scikit-learn) and Jupyter workflow for rapid prototyping [memory]. Train on Linux/Ubuntu with GPU if available via Colab
